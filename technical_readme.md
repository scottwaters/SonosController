# The Choragus — Technical README

Low-level reference for developers. For the end-user feature overview see [README.md](README.md).

---

## Project Shape

- **Choragus** — SwiftUI app target (views, ViewModels, app-level singletons).
- **SonosKit** — local Swift package (discovery, UPnP/SOAP services, models, caching, SMAPI, play history, transport strategies).
- **~24,000 lines of Swift** across 80+ source files.
- **292 unit tests** covering classifier logic, XML parsing, grace-period state machines, topology-merge invariants (value equality, stable member sort, household partitioning, grace window), protocol conformance, and model enrichment.
- **Zero external dependencies.** No CocoaPods, no Carthage, no remote SPM packages. The entire project builds against Apple's standard frameworks.
- Targets macOS 14+. Universal binary (arm64 + x86_64).

## Protocol Stack

| Protocol | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| SSDP | UDP multicast discovery of speakers on 239.255.255.250:1900 |
| Bonjour (mDNS) | `_sonos._tcp` service browsing via `NWBrowser` — runs alongside SSDP |
| UPnP/SOAP | HTTP POST + XML commands to speakers on port 1400 |
| GENA | Real-time push notifications via HTTP SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY |
| SMAPI | Music service browsing and authentication (AppLink / DeviceLink) |
| DIDL-Lite | XML metadata format for tracks, albums, playlists |
| iTunes Search API | Album art fallback + Apple Music search drill-down |
| LRCLIB | Synced + plain lyrics |
| Wikipedia REST | Per-language artist/album summaries (`{lang}.wikipedia.org`) |
| MusicBrainz | Album release dates and tracklists |
| Last.fm | Bios (with `lang=`), tags, similar artists, scrobbling |

All speaker communication is local — no cloud service is required beyond optional SMAPI authentication flows with individual music services.

## Architecture Highlights

### Service Layer (Interface Segregation)

11 focused service protocols instead of a single fat interface:

`PlaybackService`, `VolumeService`, `EQService`, `QueueService`, `BrowsingService`, `GroupingService`, `AlarmService`, `MusicServiceDetection`, `TransportStateProviding`, `ArtCache`.

ViewModels depend on protocol types, not `SonosManager` directly. `MockSonosServices` provides testable stand-ins for all protocols.

### Transport Strategies

Two implementations of `TransportStrategy` behind a single protocol:

- **`HybridEventFirstTransport`** (default) — subscribes to UPnP GENA events, falls back to targeted polling when subscriptions fail. Reconciliation poll every 30 s as a safety net. Position polled every 1 s for smooth seek-bar.
- **`LegacyPollingTransport`** — pure 5-second SOAP polling. Compatibility fallback for networks where multicast GENA is unreliable.

Switchable in Settings → System.

### Topology Management

`GetZoneGroupState` is called per-coordinator, and its response describes only that household's groups. Two households on the same LAN (S1 + S2) return disjoint topologies.

`SonosManager.refreshTopology` merges new groups into the existing list **per household** — never wholesale replacement. Pre-household-ID cache entries are backfilled on first live refresh when their coordinator's household becomes known. Each refresh is serialized per-household via `refreshingHouseholds: Set<String>` so S1 and S2 don't block each other.

**Defensive rules to avoid speaker flicker:**

1. `handleDiscoveredDevice` preserves any previously-resolved `householdID` across `GetHouseholdID` retries. A transient SOAP failure must not wipe a known household — seeding `device.householdID = existing?.householdID` before the fresh fetch makes the write idempotent when the retry fails.
2. `refreshTopology` aborts if the source device's household is still `nil`. Merging with a `nil` household would let the filter `groups.filter { $0.householdID != household }` retain every known-household group while appending new `nil`-tagged duplicates — producing visible duplicates and section reshuffles on subsequent rescans.
3. Members constructed in the topology loop inherit the source device's resolved `softwareVersion` / `swGen` only when the existing entry's corresponding field is empty, so a known fact is never downgraded to unknown.
4. **Members are stably sorted by `id` at construction.** `SonosGroup` conforms to `Equatable` by synthesis, and array equality is order-sensitive — a pure reorder in the next topology response would otherwise trip the change detector.
5. **Writes into `devices` are equality-guarded.** `@Published` on a dictionary fires on every assignment, regardless of whether the new value differs. Unconditional writes cascade re-renders through every `@EnvironmentObject` observer, which was triggering `onChange(of: groups)`-bound scroll animations even when `groups` itself was unchanged.
6. **Group-removal grace window (`groupRemovalGrace = 30 s`).** Different Sonos speakers in the same household occasionally return subtly different `GetZoneGroupState` views while state propagates. A single source's topology is no longer treated as authoritative for immediate removal — a group missing from the new response is retained if its id was present in *any* topology within the grace window. Only groups absent for longer than 30 s are actually dropped.

**Defensive rules for artwork on radio streams:**

1. `ArtResolver.handleTrackURIChanged` does **not** clear `radioTrackArtURL` when a new radio track starts. The prior track's art stays visible until `searchRadioTrackArt` completes its iTunes lookup and sets the new URL (or clears it explicitly on no-match). This eliminates the `old-track-art → station-art → new-track-art` flicker sequence during radio advances.
2. `NowPlayingViewModel.searchRadioTrackArt` short-circuits when `transportState.isActive == false`. While paused, stream-content pings oscillate `title` between empty and populated; without the guard, each oscillation would clear radio art and then re-search, producing a visible flicker even though no real track change occurred.

### S1 / S2 Classification

Speakers self-identify via the UPnP device-description fields:

- `<swGen>` — canonical Sonos platform flag (`1` = S1, `2` = S2). Preferred when present.
- `<softwareVersion>` — firmware major version (≥ 12 ⇒ S2, < 12 ⇒ S1). Fallback.

Logic lives in `SonosSystemVersion.classify(swGen:softwareVersion:)` with 17 dedicated unit tests.

### Cache Layers

- **Topology cache** (`topology_cache.json`) — groups, devices, browse sections. Enables Quick Start mode. No TTL; staleness detected on SOAP failure (`withStaleHandling`).
- **Image cache** (`ImageCache/`) — two-tier (`NSCache` + disk). LRU eviction. Configurable size (100 MB – 5 GB) and age (7 d – ∞).
- **Art URL cache** (`art_url_cache.json`) — persisted URL lookups keyed by item ID, resource URI, title, normalized title. Debounced 2 s writes.
- **Play history** (`play_history.sqlite`) — SQLite database. SQL-based filtering for 50,000+ entries.

All cache files are created with `0o600` permissions.

### Security

- **Keychain** — all credentials (SMAPI tokens, Last.fm API app credentials, Last.fm session keys) live in a single unified `SecretsStore` Keychain item with `kSecAttrAccessibleWhenUnlockedThisDeviceOnly`. One ACL means one authorization prompt per rebuild instead of one per credential. Legacy per-service Keychain items migrate automatically on first launch. Metadata (which services are connected) stored separately in Application Support JSON.
- **Scrobbling credentials** — BYO-only. The app ships no bundled Last.fm API key; users register their own at last.fm/api/account/create and paste it into Settings. Submissions are computed entirely from the local `play_history` table — no new network taps on the speakers.
- **App sandbox** — network client + server entitlements only. No filesystem, no contacts, no other apps.
- **ATS hardened** — specific domain exceptions for legacy HTTP radio services (TuneIn, 1.fm, radiotime.com), no blanket `NSAllowsArbitraryLoads`.
- **Error sanitization** — SOAP faults/HTTP errors surface user-friendly messages; raw details never exposed.
- **No telemetry** — no analytics, no crash reporting, no network calls outside Sonos LAN and explicitly-invoked music services / iTunes Search / GitHub releases (update check only).

### Discovery

Two parallel discovery transports behind `SpeakerDiscovery`:

- **`SSDPDiscovery`** — UDP multicast M-SEARCH to `239.255.255.250:1900`. Works on flat networks; commonly blocked across VLANs.
- **`MDNSDiscovery`** — `NWBrowser` over `_sonos._tcp`. Works wherever mDNS is reflected (most modern routers). The TXT record carries the same `location` URL plus the household ID, so post-discovery is unchanged and `GetHouseholdID` is skipped — measurable on S1.

`DiscoveryMode` enum (Auto / Bonjour / Legacy Multicast) is bound to `Settings → Discovery`. Auto wraps both transports in a parallel-merge that dedupes by location URL. The other two run a single transport so users on hostile networks can isolate which one is working.

`Info.plist` declares `NSBonjourServices` for `_sonos._tcp`; `NSLocalNetworkUsageDescription` covers the Local Network permission for both transports.

See [docs/DISCOVERY.md](docs/DISCOVERY.md) for the full design.

### Localization (L10n)

Dictionary-based localization in `Packages/SonosKit/Sources/SonosKit/Localization/L10n.swift`. Keys are looked up against `UserDefaults[UDKey.appLanguage]` with English as the fallback. Supported languages: English, German, French, Dutch, Spanish, Italian, Swedish, Norwegian (nb), Danish, Japanese, Portuguese, Polish, Chinese Simplified.

**Invariant:** every new user-visible string surface must:

1. Add a `public static var` accessor (or `public static func` for format strings) to `L10n`.
2. Add the translation entry to the `translations` dictionary covering all 13 locales.
3. Reference via `L10n.keyName` (not hardcoded literals).

Format-string helpers use `String(format:)` with `%1$@` / `%2$@` positional placeholders so translations can reorder arguments — see `L10n.updateAvailableBody(current:latest:)` for the canonical example.

**Pre-commit gate:** Swift 6 asserts on duplicate dict-literal keys at first access (EXC_BREAKPOINT before the app draws a window). The recommended check is:

```bash
grep -nE '^[[:space:]]+"[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_]*":[[:space:]]*\[' \
  Packages/SonosKit/Sources/SonosKit/Localization/L10n.swift \
  | awk -F'"' '{print $2}' | sort | uniq -c | awk '$1 > 1 {print}'
```

**Help body:** as of v3.7 the entire `HelpView` body prose (every heading, paragraph, and bullet across 10 topics) is fully localised across all 13 languages. v4.0 added two new topics (Now Playing details, Music Services) and expanded Preferences from 5 to 11 bullets — all entries ship complete translations.

**Language-aware metadata:** Wikipedia, MusicBrainz, and Last.fm queries follow the user's app language. `MusicMetadataService.wikipediaLanguageCode()` resolves the per-language Wikipedia subdomain; `lastFMLanguageCode()` produces the Last.fm `lang=` parameter. Cache keys in `MetadataCacheRepository` carry a `<lang>|` prefix so an English bio and a German bio coexist instead of overwriting. A one-shot `metadataCache.langPrefixMigrated.v1` UserDefault flag drives the SQLite UPDATE that renames legacy unprefixed rows on first launch under v4.0.

**AppKit-hosted windows:** SwiftUI views inside `NSHostingController` (About box, Help window, Listening Stats) don't observe `UserDefaults[UDKey.appLanguage]` automatically. `LanguageReactiveContainer` wraps them with `@AppStorage(UDKey.appLanguage)` + `.id(appLanguage)` so a language flip rebuilds the view tree. Segmented `Picker` controls also cache their rendered labels — they get `.languageReactive()` applied to invalidate the cache on flip.

See [docs/LOCALIZATION.md](docs/LOCALIZATION.md) for the full design.

### First-Run Welcome

`FirstRunWelcomeView` is shown once after the main window first appears. Dismissal is persisted via `UserDefaults[firstRunWelcome.shown]`. The dialog's *Open Settings* button directly opens the Settings sheet (via the existing `.openSettings` notification) so users can jump to Settings → Music without navigating the toolbar.

### Update Channel

Two-tier system. Sparkle 2 is the primary path; the GitHub-API checker is the fallback.

**Sparkle 2 (primary).** Active when `Info.plist` carries a non-empty `SUFeedURL` and `SUPublicEDKey`. Both keys are placeholders (`$(SPARKLE_FEED_URL)` / `$(SPARKLE_PUBLIC_KEY)`) populated at build time from environment-driven build settings. The release pipeline injects them; ad-hoc and Debug builds leave them empty so Sparkle stays inert.

`SparkleUpdaterObserver.makeForApp()` checks the substituted values for empty / unsubstituted state; when valid, it constructs `SPUStandardUpdaterController(startingUpdater: true, …)` and exposes the `SPUUpdater` plus its KVO state (`canCheckForUpdates`, `automaticallyChecksForUpdates`, `automaticallyDownloadsUpdates`, `lastUpdateCheckDate`) via `@Published` for the SwiftUI Settings panel and Check-for-Updates menu item. The appcast is signed with an EdDSA private key held only by the release-signer; verification keeps the public key in the shipping bundle and rejects unsigned or wrongly-signed payloads at install time.

**GitHub-API fallback (`UpdateChecker.swift`).** Active only when Sparkle is inert. Queries `api.github.com/repos/scottwaters/Choragus/releases/latest`, compares `tag_name` (normalised — strips leading "v", extracts numeric run) against the running `CFBundleShortVersionString` using a pure numeric semver comparator. Silent background check at most once per 24 h at launch (`UserDefaults[updateChecker.lastCheck]`). Manual check from the app menu always reports a result. Notification-only — opens the GitHub release page in the user's browser; no install path. All outcomes (`available`, `current`, `error`) logged via `sonosDebugLog`.

**Settings → Software Updates** in the System tab is rendered only when Sparkle is active. Three controls: auto-check toggle (off = "no scheduled checks", manual still works), auto-download toggle (disabled until auto-check is on), and a Check Now button with a last-checked timestamp. State flows through `SparkleUpdaterObserver`; both toggles write back to `SPUUpdater` so changes persist in Sparkle's standard `SUEnableAutomaticChecks` / `SUAutomaticallyUpdate` defaults keys.

## Building From Source

**Prerequisites:** Xcode 15 or later. macOS 14+ SDK.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/scottwaters/Choragus.git
cd Choragus

xcodebuild -scheme Choragus \
  -configuration Release \
  -destination 'platform=macOS' \
  CONFIGURATION_BUILD_DIR="$(pwd)/build" \
  ONLY_ACTIVE_ARCH=NO \
  ARCHS="arm64 x86_64" \
  build
```

The resulting app is at `build/Choragus.app`. Use `-configuration Debug` for a debug build with symbols and `DEBUG` defined.

The project file is signing-neutral — no team ID, no provisioning profile, automatic style — so it builds cleanly under any identity (or none) without modification.

### Running Tests

```bash
cd Packages/SonosKit
swift test
```

The Swift Package Manager target for `SonosKit` is self-contained and runs independently of the app target. Tests are organized into five files covering XML parsing, service protocols, model enrichment, session state, and the `SonosSystemVersion` classifier.

### Project Conventions

- **Build output** — always to `build/Choragus.app` at the project root. Avoid DerivedData for command-line builds.
- **Universal binary** — CI should always pass `ONLY_ACTIVE_ARCH=NO ARCHS="arm64 x86_64"`.
- **Kill before rebuild** — `pkill -x Choragus` (or `killall Choragus`) before a rebuild to avoid stale state.
- **No force-unwraps** — use `guard let` with a safe fallback (see `SonosDevice.fallbackURL` pattern).
- **Debug logging** — `sonosDebugLog(_:)` writes to `~/Library/Containers/com.choragus.app/Data/Library/Application Support/Choragus/sonos_debug.log` in DEBUG builds. Look for `[DISCOVERY]`, `[UPDATE]`, and similar prefixes.
