# Caching System

SonosController uses three caching layers to minimise latency and provide instant startup.

## 1. Topology Cache (Speaker Layout)

**Location:** `~/Library/Application Support/SonosController/topology_cache.json`
**Format:** JSON
**Contents:** Zone groups, devices (IP, UUID, room name, model), browse sections

### How it works

- **On successful discovery:** the current speaker topology and browse sections are serialized to JSON and written to disk.
- **On next launch (Quick Start mode):** the cached topology is loaded before SSDP discovery begins. The UI renders immediately with cached rooms and browse categories.
- **Background refresh:** SSDP discovery runs simultaneously. When the first live speaker responds, the topology is refreshed from the network and the cache is updated.
- **Transition:** `isUsingCachedData` flips to `false` and the blue cache banner disappears once live data replaces the cached data.

### Stale data handling

If a user taps a room whose speaker IP has changed since the cache was written:

1. The SOAP command fails with a network timeout
2. `withStaleHandling()` catches the error
3. `staleMessage` is set — an orange warning banner appears in the UI
4. `rescan()` is triggered — SSDP re-discovers all speakers
5. The topology updates with correct IPs
6. The banner auto-dismisses

The user sees a brief "not responding, refreshing..." message and the speaker list corrects itself within a few seconds.

### Settings

- **Quick Start mode (default):** loads from cache, refreshes in background
- **Classic mode:** ignores cache, waits for live discovery
- **Clear Speaker Cache:** removes the JSON file; next launch discovers fresh

## 2. Album Art Cache (Images)

**Location:** `~/Library/Application Support/SonosController/ImageCache/`
**Format:** JPEG files (80% quality compression)
**Key:** Deterministic hash of the image URL

### Memory tier

- `NSCache` with 200 image limit and 50 MB cost limit
- Checked first on every image request
- Evicted automatically by the system under memory pressure
- Populated from disk cache hits and network fetches

### Disk tier

- JPEG files stored in the ImageCache directory
- 500 MB default maximum (configurable) — LRU eviction removes oldest-accessed files when exceeded
- File modification date is updated on each read (touch) to track access recency
- Survives app restarts

### Flow

```
Image requested for URL
  → Check memory cache (NSCache)
    → HIT: return instantly
    → MISS: Check disk cache
      → HIT: load from disk, store in memory, return
      → MISS: Fetch from speaker over HTTP
        → Store in memory + disk, return
```

### Where it's used

- **Now Playing** album art (large, 180x180)
- **Queue** thumbnails (36x36)
- **Browse** list thumbnails (40x40)

All three views use `CachedAsyncImage`, a drop-in replacement for SwiftUI's `AsyncImage` that integrates with `ImageCache.shared`.

### Settings

- **Clear Artwork Cache:** removes all files from the ImageCache directory and clears the memory cache. Shows current disk usage in the button label.

## 3. Art URL Cache (Persistent)

**Location:** `~/Library/Application Support/SonosController/art_url_cache.json`
**Format:** JSON dictionary mapping keys to art URLs

### Problem

When browsing Sonos Favorites, many items (especially Calm Radio, some streaming services) have album art URLs in their DIDL metadata that rotate or expire between sessions. The speaker returns different URLs each time, so the image disk cache (keyed by URL hash) misses on restart even though the correct image was previously downloaded.

### Solution

Art URLs discovered during playback or browsing are persisted to disk as a `[String: String]` dictionary. Each art URL is stored under multiple keys for flexible lookup:

- **Item ID** (e.g. `FV:2/118`) — direct favorite lookup
- **Resource URI** — the playable stream URI
- **Title** (e.g. `title:native flute`) — case-insensitive title match
- **Normalized title** (e.g. `norm:native flute`) — fuzzy match with common words stripped

### Flow

```
Favorite displayed in browse list
  → Check art URL cache by item ID
    → HIT: use cached URL → ImageCache loads image from disk
    → MISS: Check by resource URI, title, normalized title
      → HIT: use cached URL → ImageCache loads image from disk
      → MISS: Use DIDL albumArtURI or run discovery cascade
        → Store discovered URL under all keys
        → Debounced persist to disk (2 second delay)
```

### Persistence

- Saved via `SonosCache.saveArtURLs()` with a 2-second debounce to batch rapid updates
- Restored on startup in `startDiscovery()` before any UI renders
- Independent of Quick Start / Classic startup mode

## 4. Optimistic State Cache (In-Memory)

Not a traditional cache, but a grace period system that temporarily holds user-intended state to prevent polling from reverting it.

### Problem

When you press Play, the app sends a SOAP `Play` command to the speaker. The speaker takes 1-3 seconds to start playing (buffering audio). During this time, the 2-second polling cycle queries `GetTransportInfo`, which still returns `STOPPED` or `TRANSITIONING`. Without protection, the UI would flip the icon back to "play" even though your command is in flight.

### Solution

Each state category has a grace timestamp:
- `transportGraceUntil` — protects play/pause state
- `volumeGraceUntil` — protects volume slider
- `muteGraceUntil` — protects mute toggle
- `modeGraceUntil` — protects shuffle/repeat

When an action is taken:
1. The UI state is updated optimistically (immediately)
2. The grace timestamp is set to `now + 5 seconds`
3. The SOAP command is sent
4. During polling, if the grace period is active, the polled value is ignored for that category
5. Exception: if the polled value matches the intended state (speaker caught up), the grace ends early

This means:
- **Play:** icon flips to pause immediately, stays there for up to 5 seconds regardless of what the speaker reports
- **Volume:** slider holds your position for 5 seconds, won't snap back
- **Shuffle/Repeat:** toggle flips immediately, won't revert

### Duration

5 seconds was chosen because:
- Most Sonos commands are acknowledged within 1-2 seconds
- Buffering for streaming content can take up to 3-4 seconds
- 5 seconds provides margin without being noticeably stale
